#### Introduction 
<p>Following the CRISP-DM, the next stage of our project is Data Preparation. This focuses on getting the data ready for a customer churn prediction project. After stating our business objectives and identifying the data we need in previous phases, this phase involves selecting, cleaning, constructing, integrating, and formatting data to ensure high-quality inputs for analysis (Luna, 2021). We will dive deeper into the data source selected, determine which team members to collaborate with for the e-commerce company, address data quality issues like missing values and outliers, and select the right models for discovering patterns in customer behavior. </p>

#### Data Sources and Acquisition
<p>We are using the "Ecommerce Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction" dataset from Kaggle by Ankit Verma, which is a synthetic dataset. Information about where the original dataset was acquired is unknown, but in a real-life situation, an online retail company would source the data from multiple systems. This includes a CRM system for customer demographics and order history, and a mobile application for behavioral information. The data acquisition methods would vary based on the database infrastructure. For structured databases, SQL queries would extract the needed information. For consolidating multiple sources, ETL pipelines would combine data into a centralized data warehouse (Luna, 2021). This approach ensures a complete customer profile is created for accurate churn prediction modeling.</p>

#### Team Collaboration
<p>To prepare the data for churn prediction, the data requires collaboration between technical teams and business stakeholders. The technical team includes data engineers, IT, and the analytics team. The data engineering team would extract, clean, and transform data from systems like CRM, web analytics, and order management databases while the IT department would handle secure data access and system permissions. As for the analytics team, they would define what variables are needed for the churn models. On the business side, marketing, customer service, and operations teams would provide insights on customer behavior, satisfaction trends, and fulfillment issues that impact retention. Cross-functional collaboration ensures that data strategy, collection, and validation are coordinated across departments (HockeyStack, 2025). Leadership principles emphasizing adaptability and communication help align the data preparation with business goals (Maxwell, 2019).</p>

#### Data Preparation
<p>Having clean data is necessary for the modeling group to produce reliable results, so the preparation step needs to be efficient. The first issue we would address is missing values. If only a few rows have missing data, we would remove them. If there are more missing values than expected, then we would impute them using the median values for numerical features and the most frequent category for categorical features (Luna, 2021). Next we would check data types to make sure that they are formatted correctly. For example, numerical fields should only contain numbers and dates should be in a valid format. We would also look for outliers using z-scores or interquartile range and visualize them with box plots to decide which are real extreme values versus errors to be removed. Other methods we will use are removing duplicate customer records and encoding categorical variables like Gender, Marital Status, and City Tier into numerical formats that the models can use. These steps ensure the data is ready for churn prediction modeling.</p>

#### Modeling Approach and Rationale
<p>To find meaningful patterns related to customer churn, we would use several modeling approaches. Since churn is a binary outcome, we would use classification models like logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, and support vector machines to estimate churn probability and identify key variables that influence customer decisions (Davenport & Harris, 2017). Clustering techniques like k-means would help with customer segmentation by identifying groups with similar behavior patterns, allowing us to target high-risk clusters. Regression models could predict customer value or spending patterns to prioritize retention efforts. Using a combination of these models gives us a complete approach to understanding churn and making data-driven decisions that align with organizational goals (Ladley, 2020).</p>
