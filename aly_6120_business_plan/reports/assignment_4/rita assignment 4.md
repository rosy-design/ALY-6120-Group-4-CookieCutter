Modeling Approach and Rationale

To find meaningful patterns related to customer churn, a number of modeling approaches are considered appropriate. Because churn is a binary outcome, such classification models as logistic regression, decision trees, or a gradient boosting machines are used to estimate the churn probability and identify the key variables that influence the customer decisions (Davenport & Harris, 2017). Clustering techniques such as k-means help in segmentation by identifying cohorts with similar behavior patterns and thus helping the organization to better target the high-risk clusters. Regression models can also be used to predict customer value or spending patterns, providing more insight on priorities for retention. It is a combination of these models that allows for a holistic approach to churn and data driven decision making that is aligned with organizational strategy (Ladley, 2020).
