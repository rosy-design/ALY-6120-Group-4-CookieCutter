4. Identify the team members you would collaborate with
5. Describe the preparation, including quality problems such as missing data, incorrect data, and outliers that would be necessary before handing off the data to the modeling group
6. In order to discover meaningful patterns in the data, which model(s) would you employ, and why?

note: word count should be max 500.

### Para 1: answer questions 1-3
- using a dataset from Kaggle

- see if there are any extreme outliers and what is our plan

### Para 4: answering question 6
- Recall the models we mentioned (classification, clustering, regression) and why we chose them
