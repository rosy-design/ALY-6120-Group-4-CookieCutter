Understanding customer churn is essential for sustaining long-term profitability and competitiveness in e-commerce environments. The CRISP-DM Data Understanding phase provides the foundation for identifying the right variables, data sources, and structures necessary to analyze the drivers of churn effectively. As Collier (2012) emphasizes, analytics initiatives must begin with identifying high-quality, business-relevant data that accurately reflects customer behavior and operational processes. Similarly, Provost and Fawcett (2013) note that meaningful predictive modeling requires selecting variables that directly influence the target outcome. For this project, the chosen dataset aligns closely with established churn predictors across behavioral, demographic, transactional, and satisfaction domains. Incorporating diverse data sources and robust variables strengthens the reliability of churn modeling and supports evidence-based retention strategies, consistent with the data-driven approach advocated by Saporito (2015).
This introduction frames the importance of selecting appropriate data and establishes the analytical reasoning behind the dataset chosen for the project.Understanding customer churn is essential for sustaining long-term profitability and competitiveness in e-commerce environments.
