## Assignment 5 Breakdown
Need to answer:
1. Identify your model or models
2. Describe how the model(s) will address the business problem
3. Explain the pros and cons of the model(s) you chose
4. Name the team members you would collaborate with
5. Highlight any potential data quality issues with your model(s)
6. What patterns are you looking for this model to illustrate?

#### Task Breakadown 
Para 1: answer questions 1-2
- list out the models we mentioned before: logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, SVM, k-means clustering, and regression for CLV
- explain how each one helps us predict which customers will churn
- connect back to 2REN's goals

#### Para 2: answering question 3
- go through each model and talk about what's good about it
- is it accurate, can we understand it
- does it handle complex patterns
- then talk about what's not so good
- does it overfit, is it slow, is it hard to explain to business people

#### Para 3: answering questions 4 & 5
- thinking about who we need to work with for modeling
- data scientists, ML engineers, business analysts, people from marketing and customer service who know the business
- could split them into technical people vs business stakeholders
- what problems might we run into with the data
- like we probably have way more customers who didn't churn than ones who did, models might overfit or underfit, features might be too correlated, outliers could mess up accuracy

#### Para 4: answering question 6
- what are we hoping to see from these models
- which things actually predict churn
- is it how long they've been a customer, how often they order, their satisfaction scores, if they complain
- can we find groups of customers who are high risk
- when do customers usually churn is there a timing pattern
- what behaviors lead to them leaving
